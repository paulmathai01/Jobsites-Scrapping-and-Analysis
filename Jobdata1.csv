 DATA SCIENCE INTERN - GAME FRANCHISE ANALYTICS 

 Greetings, students! We’re geared up here to offer another round of epic internship experiences in summer 2020. The internship program offers the opportunity to pause your studies for one summer and work side-by-side with Blizzard Entertainment employees in your area of interest, doing real work that oftentimes ends up in production. As such, we hold you to the same high standards as anybody else in the company. 

 Just like our gameplay experiences, Blizzard internships are a fully immersive experience. We want interns who are enthusiastic about what they want to do for a living and excited to come in every day to learn and contribute in this hyper-creative atmosphere. Being fully engaged with our team also means communicating effectively and maintaining an open mind - one that is receptive to feedback and able to adapt and grow. Your hobbies and interests can also play in your favor. Passion for technology, gaming, game development, and an in-depth knowledge of Blizzard games, products, and services will always be a plus with us, regardless of the position you’re applying for. Be passionate about who you are, be into our industry, and be willing to go all-in and embrace this opportunity to the fullest! 

 QUEST OBJECTIVES 

 We’re seeking post-graduate students to help us analyze and build data-powered products and services for Blizzard. Interns will follow the full end-to-end project model used by data scientists at Blizzard and have the opportunity to share their results with game and product teams. Intern projects are tailored to candidate strengths and fit to ongoing opportunities across game teams and Blizzard-wide services. 

 What’s life like as a data scientist and what can you expect? Whether working with game teams (e.g., Hearthstone, Overwatch, or WoW) or support teams (e.g., Battle.net or marketing) we regularly meet stakeholders to define and refine our project goals.

 Veracity Forecasting and Analysis, an SPA Company, is part of the Joint, Land, Air, and Space Division within SPA. Our unique processes result in authoritative, data-driven analyses that assist enterprise managers in making complicated decisions. We offer our customers proven expertise in descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics; advanced mathematics and computational techniques (a.k.a. data science); and software engineering. Our mission is to help enterprise leaders make complex, fully informed decisions and save money in the process. #CJ #IN123 

 Responsibilities 

 Everybody’s view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. At Veracity, we view data science as a way of understanding “how the world works.” We make assumptions and models then use data of all sorts to validate or disprove them. Our customers ask tough questions about managing their multifaceted enterprises; we build and operate complex models and simulations to provide the answers that best address the decisions they face. 

 We don’t expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you’re stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you would fit in well with our team of analysts. 

 We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we spend a lot of time wrangling data. This includes combing data from disparate data systems, manipulating formats, and cleaning—all of which are required to make the modeling happen. For this critical work we need someone who is precise, efficient, and tenacious.

Why Clarity Insights, Why Consulting and Why Now? 

 We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers – you know – GEEK OUT. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles.

All our vehicles are inspected and reconditioned based on our 150-point certification checklist and come with a 7-day return policy. We also operate our own logistics network to deliver cars to customers as soon as the next day, as well as offer customer pick-up at our state-of-the-art Car Vending Machine locations (yes, you read that right). By putting customer satisfaction at the core of our business, we've built a no-pressure, no-haggle online car buying experience that our customers time and money.

We pride ourselves on quality work that’s grounded in complete transparency and accountability.

PythonOptoro is a fast-growing technology company that is revolutionizing the retail industry. Every year, more than 15% of retail goods are returned or simply never sell. This creates tons of unnecessary waste and costs retailers billions. 

 Our mission is to make retail more sustainable by eliminating all waste from returns. Our technology platform connects every returned item to its best home, thereby increasing profitability for retailers, giving consumers great deals, and reducing environmental waste. 

 Backed by some of the top investors in the country - including Kleiner Perkins, Revolution Growth, and UPS - Optoro is powered by its collaborative, unconventional, and resourceful employees who love solving big problems. We are looking for individuals with similar creativity and energy to help build a lasting company focused on the triple bottom line. 

 Data Science 
------------ 

 At Optoro, we build software to help us solve this problem. We have tools that manage inventory in both ours and client warehouses, visualization and reports showing clients how much value they are getting out of their excess inventory, and entire eCommerce platforms and integrations to get these products into new and appreciative hands. 

 Core to our value is the ability to capture and analyze the vast amount of data that flows through our system from the millions of units we handle. We transform this data into action in order to more efficiently and effectively route returned items to their optimal home. We use smart algorithms to drive every piece of this journey, from initial quality assessment, to packing, to routing, to pricing (and repricing). Ultimately, we ensure that intelligent, data-driven decisions are made at every point in process.

Machine LearningAbout the Role 
At the core of our advanced analytics are our research scientists - designing, implementing, and deploying innovative solutions to a wide range of problems, such as predicting government action, analyzing the impact of regulations, creating networks of relationships, extracting patterns from web content, and modeling user behavior to personalize content relevance. Because we’re always identifying newer and more complex problems, we’re on the lookout for research scientists who thrive in environments catering to applicable analysis by day, and shoot-for-the-moon risk taking by night. You’ll lead the way in all stages of researching and developing insightful and actionable models and analysis, looking into the future and becoming an internal and external expert. 

You Will:
Explore new data sources for integration with current data and new types of analysis
Design experiments, prototype new types of models, enhance existing ones
Collaborate with engineering to build out analysis
Create and collaborate on narratives from the data, including interesting trends, insights for presentation on and off the application
You Have:
1-3+ years of practical experience in one or more of the following:
1. Machine Learning: linear models, deep learning, graphical models, bayesian modeling, supervised/unsupervised learning, content personalization 
2. Natural Language Processing: applications of ML to NLP, information extraction and retrieval, search, automated content generation, multilingual systems 
3. Computational Social Science: policy/legislative/regulatory analysis, comparative politics, financial analysis 

 About You 
You're a computer scientist looking to make an impact, a political scientist with a computational bend, an economist or statistician that yearns for more kinds of data, a machine learning specialist that wants to push the boundaries, or maybe even a physicist or mathematician who's making a transition. In any case, you become uncomfortable when you don’t understand something, and choose to relentlessly seek out solutions rather than ever give up. You’re guided equally by your own intuition and delivering the best results to the customer. You’re comfortable around ambiguity with a high degree of autonomy, and are excited about solving complex, open-ended problems by distilling the complexity as simply as necessary to build solutions that work. Along the way, you’re capable of communicating what you’re thinking to both technical and non-technical audiences, taking in others’ ideas as well as expressing your own. Interested in both theory and application, you’re equally up for creating a novel model, as well as working with product managers or journalists to define impactful problems and engineering teams to productionize it. You’ve built or deployed statistical solutions, especially involving NLP and ML, and are excited about productionizing research to push the bounds of people’s expectations.

Must Haves:

• SQL – all the way to T SQL or PL/SQL for relational databases (no real non-relational work) need to be able to manipulate existing queries and build their own

• SAS – not expected too heavy, really heavy SQL or Heavy SAS, doesn’t need to be an expert in both, just one with exposure to the other

• Excel – No visualization, mainly higher level functions (vlookups, pivot tables, OLAP, etc). will NOT need to build out visualizations for this role

• Teradata, Oracle, any relational DB is fine. Might use Hadoop but they structured it for more of a relational DB feel.

• For Senior – Needs to understand whole business unit, why reports are pulled from certain databases/classifications

• For junior – Solid comm but needs to be more ingrained in the tech. Less stakeholder comm, more actual technical analyst work
 
Nice to Haves:

• ETL – really just to know the process of moving/transforming data

• Excel/VBA Macros – heavy excel work in general but nice to have here

• Background in any industry, preferred well rounded enterprise versus pure telecomm folks

• Multiple languages – SAS, SQL, python – doesn’t want a purist, needs flexibility across the board.
